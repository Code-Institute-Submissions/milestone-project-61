# Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project
This project provides an interactive website for potential customers of an outdoor expedition company. User inputs to a series of questions populate a 3D map with a route, markers, photos, gifs and text with the goal of giving users an insight into what their expedition would be like. Using a little form-ception, the same user inputs are used to populate the values in a contact form, so if the user likes what they see, it's easier for them to get in touch.

## UX
### Users
Visitors to the website are likely to be potential customers. They might want to plan an expedition in the future, or they may be looking for something on very short notice. They might be an individial, or the might be part of a group of friends, or even looking for a team building exercise for a school or corporate group. 

These users will need to be able to find out a bit more about the company, see what an expedition with them would be like, and have a way to get in touch with the company. To design the website to meet these needs, the four potential user stories set out below have been followed. 

### User Stories

1. As an individiaul who loves going walking outdoors, I want to explore Scotland. I'd like to have a good idea of what the expedition will be like, especially as I'm not a fan of water. I'd like to get in touch with the company by email first, just to ask them some questions. 
2. As a high school teacher, I want to plan an end of term camping trip for our class. I want to be able to show the kids what it will be like, so they can all get really excited. The kids are all over social media, so it would be great if they could check it out before hand and post their photos there after.  
3. As a company manager in charge of booking this years team building, I want to organise something a bit different. It'd be great if I could show them what it will be like, so they know it won't be a let down like last year. 
4. As a group of friends looking for something to do tomorrow, we want to organise something straight away. We'd rather get in touch by phone than wait for an email response, so we know that it's all sorted. 

### Resulting Goals 
Based on these four user stories set out above, there are five main goals for this project: 
- Provide a way to display a potential expedition to users 
- Provide tailored options for individuals and different types of groups 
- Quickly provide the user with a telephone number for the company 
- Provide a way for users to get in touch with the company via email
- Provide links to the companies social media accounts

### Wireframes and Flowchart
##### Wireframes
These wireframes were sketched at the start of the design process: 
- [Home Section](readme-assets/pdf/home-sketch.pdf)
- [About Section](readme-assets/pdf/about-sketch.pdf)
- [Map Section](readme-assets/pdf/map-sketch.pdf)
- [Contact Section](readme-assets/pdf/contact-sketch.pdf)

Based on the preliminary sketches above, three sets of wireframes were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/). 
- [Phone](readme-assets/pdf/Phone.pdf)
- [Tablet](readme-assets/pdf/Tablet.pdf)
- [Laptop/Desktop](readme-assets/pdf/Desktop.pdf)

##### Flowchart
This flowchart visualises the path a user takes through the "About You" form questions.

This flowchart is useful when looking at the jquery that manipluates the user's path through the questions. 

## Design Choices
### Colours 
<img src="readme-assets/img/readme-colours.jpg" style="margin: 0;">
The colour palette consists of four colours: charcoal grey `#454545`, metallic gold `#b08d57`, metallic silver `#c0c0c0` and a metallic green `#7c9d8e`. These colours provide contrast to each other without dazzling the user with bright neon colours and they complement the colours of the images displayed across the webpage. They allow for noticable and consistent hover effects on elements across the webpage.
